### 👋 Hello, I’m AC4G

Backend engineer focused on clean, reliable APIs and backend systems that hold up under real usage — not just demos.

I’ve been building backend software since 2020, starting with pragmatic CRUD-based APIs and growing into maintaining and refactoring long-running systems. My focus is on correctness, clear system boundaries, and architectures that can evolve without breaking under change.

I enjoy working close to the metal when needed, using Rust and C for performance-critical paths, while leveraging higher-level tools where they make sense.

### 🚀 Latest Project: [**stexs-spike**](https://github.com/AC4G/stexs-spike) (Third Iteration)

**stexs-spike** is a backend platform for multiplayer games, designed to provide authentication, user management, and inventory systems as long-running, production-grade services.

The current iteration includes:
- Authentication and user accounts  
- Player inventories and cross-inventory systems  
- OAuth2 integrations  
- A web platform for profile management, social features, item purchases, and achievements  

Many of these features are already implemented. Ongoing development continues alongside a next-generation architecture that incorporates lessons learned from maintaining and refactoring real backend systems over time.

### 🔄 Upcoming Architecture: STEXS Platform (Next Iteration)

**STEXS** is a backend infrastructure platform for multiplayer games, designed to provide authentication, inventory, storage, and operational primitives as shared services — without vendor lock-in or fragmented integrations.

The platform is built backend-first, with architecture defined before feature scale.

**Key highlights:**
- Rust-based core with strong type safety and async workflows  
- Intent-driven APIs (not CRUD), designed around real business actions  
- Vertical Slice Architecture with clear domain ownership (Auth, Inventory, Storage, etc.)  
- Event-driven core using **Redpanda** for loose coupling and auditability  
- Distributed SQL via **YugabyteDB** with ACID guarantees  
- **Garnet** for low-latency caching and atomic operations, chosen for significantly higher throughput than Redis on the same hardware (even with multithreading enabled)  
- **Pingora** at the edge for request validation, rate limiting, and JWT caching  

The goal of this iteration is correctness, clarity, and long-term evolvability — building infrastructure that can grow without breaking existing integrations.
