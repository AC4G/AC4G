### üëã Hello, I‚Äôm AC4G

I am a self-taught programmer with over 5 years of experience, mainly focusing on back-end development. I started with HTML and CSS, then moved on to PHP, JavaScript and TypeScript on Node.js. Now I am passionate about low-level programming with Rust and C, aiming for performance and control in my projects.

### üöÄ Latest Project: **stexs-core** (Third Iteration)

The project delivers a comprehensive backend solution for multiplayer games, featuring authentication, user management and inventories. It also supports cross-inventory systems, OAuth2 integration, and a web platform where users can manage profiles, add friends, purchase items, and track achievements.

Many of these features are already implemented in this third iteration, while ongoing development with a new architecture will continue separately in the next version.

The upcoming version will be completely rewritten in Rust, utilizing an event-driven architecture with aggressive caching powered by Garnet. It will use Pulsar as the event system and Pingora for edge request validation, authentication, and load balancing. Data storage will be distributed via YogaByteDB, and communication will shift from REST APIs to gRPC with FlatBuffers. Pingora‚Äôs load balancer will support content negotiation through Accept headers to parse FlatBuffers into Protobuf or JSON formats on request.
